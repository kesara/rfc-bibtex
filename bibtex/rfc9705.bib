    abstract =  {The RSVP-TE Fast Reroute (FRR) extensions specified in RFC 4090 define two local repair techniques to reroute Label Switched Path (LSP) traffic over pre-established backup tunnels. Facility backup method allows one or more LSPs traversing a connected link or node to be protected using a bypass tunnel. The many-to-one nature of local repair technique is attractive from a scalability point of view. This document enumerates facility backup procedures in RFC 4090 that rely on refresh timeout, hence, making facility backup method refresh-interval dependent. The RSVP-TE extensions defined in this document will enhance the facility backup protection mechanism by making the corresponding procedures refresh-interval independent, and hence, compatible with the Refresh-Interval Independent RSVP (RI-RSVP) capability specified in RFC 8370. Hence, this document updates RFC 4090 in order to support the RI-RSVP capability specified in RFC 8370.},
