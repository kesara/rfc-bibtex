Specifically, this document provides updates to fix shortcomings in the description of some Information Elements (IEs), to ensure a consistent structure when citing an existing IANA registry, and to fix broken pointers, orphaned section references, etc. The updates are also meant to bring some consistency among the entries of the registry.},
