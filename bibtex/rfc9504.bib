    abstract =  {The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) has been extended to support stateful PCE functions where the stateful PCE maintains information about paths and resource usage within a network; however, these extensions do not cover all requirements for GMPLS networks. This document provides the extensions required for PCEP so as to enable the usage of a stateful PCE capability in GMPLS-controlled networks.},
