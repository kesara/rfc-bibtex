    abstract =  {The JSON Meta Application Protocol (JMAP) base protocol (RFC 8620) provides the ability to upload and download arbitrary binary data via HTTP POST and GET on a defined endpoint. This binary data is called a "blob". This extension adds additional ways to create and access blobs by making inline method calls within a standard JMAP request. This extension also adds a reverse lookup mechanism to discover where blobs are referenced within other data types.},
