    abstract =  {This document contains the specification for the Deterministic Networking (DetNet) YANG data model for configuration and operational data for DetNet flows. The model allows the provisioning of an end-to-end DetNet service on devices along the path without depending on any signaling protocol. It also specifies operational status for flows. The YANG module defined in this document conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA).},
