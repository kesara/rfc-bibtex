    abstract =  {This document specifies YANG modules for representing assurance graphs. These graphs represent the assurance of a given service by decomposing it into atomic assurance elements called subservices. The companion document, "Service Assurance for Intent-Based Networking Architecture" (RFC 9417), presents an architecture for implementing the assurance of such services. The YANG data models in this document conform to the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in RFC 8342.},
