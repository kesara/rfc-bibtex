    abstract =  {This document defines a YANG data model, referred to as the "AC Glue" model, to augment the LxVPN Service Model (LxSM) and LxVPN Network Model (LxNM) with references to attachment circuits (ACs). The AC Glue model enables a provider to associate Layer 2/3 VPN (LxVPN) services with the underlying AC infrastructure, thereby facilitating consistent provisioning and management of new or existing ACs in conjunction with LxVPN services. Specifically, by introducing an integrated approach to AC and LxVPN management, this model supports Attachment Circuit as a Service (ACaaS) and provides a standardized mechanism for aligning AC/VPN requests with the network configurations required to deliver them.},
