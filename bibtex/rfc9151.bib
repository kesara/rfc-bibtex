    abstract =  {This document defines a base profile for TLS protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3 as well as DTLS protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3 for use with the US Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite. The profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation of all components of US National Security Systems that use TLS or DTLS. It is also appropriate for all other US Government systems that process high-value information. The profile is made publicly available here for use by developers and operators of these and any other system deployments.},
