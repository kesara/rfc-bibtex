    abstract =  {This document describes a Same-Origin Policy (SOP) requirement for Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP) servers and clients. Application of a SOP in RRDP client/server communication isolates resources such as Delta and Snapshot files from different Repository Servers, reducing possible attack vectors. This document updates RFC 8182.},
