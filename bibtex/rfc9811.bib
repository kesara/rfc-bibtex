    abstract =  {This document describes how to layer the Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) over HTTP. It includes the updates to RFC 6712 specified in Section 3 of RFC 9480; these updates introduce CMP URIs using a well-known prefix. It obsoletes RFC 6712; and, together with RFC 9810, it also obsoletes RFC 9480.},
