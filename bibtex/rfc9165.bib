    abstract =  {The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), standardized in RFC 8610, provides "control operators" as its main language extension point. The present document defines a number of control operators that were not yet ready at the time RFC 8610 was completed: .plus, .cat, and .det for the construction of constants; .abnf/.abnfb for including ABNF (RFC 5234 and RFC 7405) in CDDL specifications; and .feature for indicating the use of a non-basic feature in an instance.},
