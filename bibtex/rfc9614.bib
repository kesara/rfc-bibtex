    abstract =  {This document describes the principle of privacy partitioning, which selectively spreads data and communication across multiple parties as a means to improve privacy by separating user identity from user data. This document describes emerging patterns in protocols to partition what data and metadata is revealed through protocol interactions, provides common terminology, and discusses how to analyze such models.},
