    abstract =  {This document specifies extensions to the Ethernet VPN Integrated Routing and Bridging (EVPN-IRB) procedures specified in RFCs 7432 and 9135 to enhance the mobility mechanisms for networks based on EVPN-IRB. The proposed extensions improve the handling of host mobility and duplicate address detection in EVPN-IRB networks to cover a broader set of scenarios where a host's unicast IP address to Media Access Control (MAC) address bindings may change across moves. These enhancements address limitations in the existing EVPN-IRB mobility procedures by providing more efficient and scalable solutions. The extensions are backward compatible with existing EVPN-IRB implementations and aim to optimize network performance in scenarios involving frequent IP address mobility.},
