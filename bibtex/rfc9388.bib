    abstract =  {Open Caching architecture is a use case of Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) in which the commercial Content Delivery Network (CDN) is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the ISP caching layer serves as the downstream CDN (dCDN). RFC 8006 defines footprint types that are used for footprint objects as part of the Metadata interface (MI). The footprint types are also used for the Footprint \& Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI) as defined in RFC 8008. This document defines two new footprint types. The first footprint type defined is an ISO 3166-2 country subdivision code. Defining this country subdivision code improves granularity for delegation as compared to the ISO 3166-1 country code footprint type defined in RFC 8006. The ISO 3166-2 country subdivision code is also added as a new entity domain type in the "ALTO Entity Domain Types" registry defined in Section 7.4 of RFC 9241. The second footprint type defines a footprint union to aggregate footprint objects. This allows for additive semantics over the narrowing semantics defined in Appendix B of RFC 8008 and therefore updates RFC 8008. The two new footprint types are based on the requirements raised by Open Caching but are also applicable to CDNI use cases in general.},
