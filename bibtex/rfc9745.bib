    abstract =  {The Deprecation HTTP response header field is used to signal to consumers of a resource (identified by a URI) that the resource will be or has been deprecated. Additionally, the deprecation link relation can be used to link to a resource that provides further information about planned or existing deprecation. It may also provide ways in which client application developers can best manage deprecation.},
