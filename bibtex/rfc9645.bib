    abstract =  {This document presents four YANG 1.1 modules -- three IETF modules and one supporting IANA module. The three IETF modules are "ietf-tls-common", "ietf-tls-client", and "ietf-tls-server". The "ietf-tls-client" and "ietf-tls-server" modules are the primary productions of this work, supporting the configuration and monitoring of TLS clients and servers. The IANA module is "iana-tls-cipher-suite-algs". This module defines YANG enumerations that provide support for an IANA-maintained algorithm registry.},
