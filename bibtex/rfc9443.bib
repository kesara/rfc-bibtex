    abstract =  {RFC 7983 defines a scheme for a Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) receiver to demultiplex Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS), Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN), Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) / Secure Real-time Transport Control Protocol (SRTCP), ZRTP, and Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) channel packets arriving on a single port. This document updates RFC 7983 and RFC 5764 to also allow QUIC packets to be multiplexed on a single receiving socket.},
