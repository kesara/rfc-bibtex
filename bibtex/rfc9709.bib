    abstract =  {This document specifies the derivation of the content-encryption key or the content-authenticated-encryption key in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) using the HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF) with SHA-256. The use of this mechanism provides protection against an attacker that manipulates the content-encryption algorithm identifier or the content-authenticated-encryption algorithm identifier.},
