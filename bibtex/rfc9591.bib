    abstract =  {This document specifies the Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold (FROST) signing protocol. FROST signatures can be issued after a threshold number of entities cooperate to compute a signature, allowing for improved distribution of trust and redundancy with respect to a secret key. FROST depends only on a prime-order group and cryptographic hash function. This document specifies a number of ciphersuites to instantiate FROST using different prime-order groups and hash functions. This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) in the IRTF.},
