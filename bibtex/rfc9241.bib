    abstract =  {The Content Delivery Networks Interconnection (CDNI) framework in RFC 6707 defines a set of protocols to interconnect CDNs to achieve multiple goals, including extending the reach of a given CDN. A CDNI Request Routing Footprint \& Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI) is needed to achieve the goals of a CDNI. RFC 8008 defines the FCI semantics and provides guidelines on the FCI protocol, but the exact protocol is not specified. This document defines a new Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) service, called "CDNI Advertisement Service", that provides an implementation of the FCI, following the guidelines defined in RFC 8008.},
