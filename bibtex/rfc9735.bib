    abstract =  {This document defines how to use the Address Family Identifier (AFI) 17 "Distinguished Name" in the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP). LISP introduces two new numbering spaces: Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and Routing Locators (RLOCs). Distinguished Names (DNs) can be used in either EID-Records or RLOC-Records in LISP control messages to convey additional information.},
