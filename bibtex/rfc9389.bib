    abstract =  {The IETF Nominating Committee (NomCom) appoints candidates to several IETF leadership committees. RFC 8713 provides criteria for NomCom membership that attempt to ensure NomCom volunteers are members of the loosely defined IETF community, by requiring in-person attendance in three of the past five in-person meetings. In 2020 and 2021, the IETF had six consecutive fully online plenary meetings that drove rapid advancement in remote meeting technologies and procedures, including an experiment that included remote attendance for NomCom eligibility. This document updates RFC 8713 by defining a new set of eligibility criteria from first principles, with consideration to the increased salience of remote attendance. This document obsoletes RFCs 8788 and 8989.},
