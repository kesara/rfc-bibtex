    abstract =  {This document presents an extension to the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) for the purpose of group key management. The protocol is in conformance with the Multicast Security (MSEC) Group Key Management architecture, which contains two components: member registration and group rekeying. Both components are required for a Group Controller/Key Server (GCKS) to provide authorized Group Members (GMs) with IPsec Group Security Associations (GSAs). The GMs then exchange IP multicast or other group traffic as IPsec packets. This document obsoletes RFC 6407.},
