    abstract =  {This document specifies two new Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) attributes that carry DHCP options. The specification is generic and can be applicable to any service that relies upon DHCP. Both DHCPv4- and DHCPv6-configured services are covered. Also, this document updates RFC 4014 by relaxing a constraint on permitted RADIUS attributes in the RADIUS Attributes DHCP suboption.},
