    abstract =  {The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), standardized in RFC 8610, provides "control operators" as its main language extension point. RFCs have added to this extension point in both an application-specific and a more general way. The present document defines a number of additional generally applicable control operators for text conversion (bytes, integers, printf-style formatting, and JSON) and for an operation on text.},
