    abstract =  {This document presents three IETF-defined YANG modules and a script used to create four supporting IANA modules. The three IETF modules are ietf-ssh-common, ietf-ssh-client, and ietf-ssh-server. The "ietf-ssh-client" and "ietf-ssh-server" modules are the primary productions of this work, supporting the configuration and monitoring of Secure Shell (SSH) clients and servers. The four IANA modules are iana-ssh-encryption-algs, iana-ssh-key-exchange-algs, iana-ssh-mac-algs, and iana-ssh-public-key-algs. These modules each define YANG enumerations providing support for an IANA-maintained algorithm registry.},
