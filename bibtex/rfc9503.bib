    abstract =  {Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) forwarding planes. This document specifies Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) extensions (as described in RFC 8762) for SR networks, for both the SR-MPLS and SRv6 forwarding planes, by augmenting the optional extensions defined in RFC 8972.},
