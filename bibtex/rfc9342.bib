    abstract =  {This document generalizes and expands the Alternate-Marking methodology to measure any kind of unicast flow whose packets can follow several different paths in the network; this can result in a multipoint-to-multipoint network. The network clustering approach is presented and, for this reason, the technique described here is called "Clustered Alternate Marking". This document obsoletes RFC 8889.},
