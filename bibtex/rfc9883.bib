    abstract =  {This document specifies an attribute for a statement of possession of a private key by a certificate subject. As part of X.509 certificate enrollment, a Certification Authority (CA) typically demands proof that the subject possesses the private key that corresponds to the to-be-certified public key. In some cases, a CA might accept a signed statement from the certificate subject. For example, when a certificate subject needs separate certificates for signature and key establishment, a statement that can be validated with the previously issued signature certificate for the same subject might be adequate for subsequent issuance of the key establishment certificate.},
