    abstract =  {This document describes an architectural framework for MPLS Network Action (MNA) technologies. MNA technologies are used to indicate actions that impact the forwarding or other processing (such as monitoring) of the packet along the Label Switched Path (LSP) of the packet and to transfer any additional data needed for these actions. This document provides the foundation for the development of a common set of network actions and information elements supporting additional operational models and capabilities of MPLS networks.},
