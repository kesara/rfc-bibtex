    abstract =  {This document defines a protocol for tunneling DTLS traffic in multimedia conferences that enables a Media Distributor to facilitate key exchange between an endpoint in a conference and the Key Distributor. The protocol is designed to ensure that the keying material used for hop-by-hop encryption and authentication is accessible to the Media Distributor, while the keying material used for end-to-end encryption and authentication is inaccessible to the Media Distributor.},
