    abstract =  {This document specifies how Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) can be used by a client to obtain a certificate for a subdomain identifier from a certification authority. Additionally, this document specifies how a client can fulfill a challenge against an ancestor domain but may not need to fulfill a challenge against the explicit subdomain if certification authority policy allows issuance of the subdomain certificate without explicit subdomain ownership proof.},
