    abstract =  {BCP 172 (i.e., RFC 6472) recommends not using AS\_SET and AS\_CONFED\_SET AS\_PATH segment types in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). This document advances that recommendation to a standards requirement in BGP; it prohibits the use of the AS\_SET and AS\_CONFED\_SET path segment types in the AS\_PATH. This is done to simplify the design and implementation of BGP and to make the semantics of the originator of a BGP route clearer. This will also simplify the design, implementation, and deployment of various BGP security mechanisms. This document updates RFC 4271 by deprecating the origination of BGP routes with AS\_SET (Type 1 AS\_PATH segment) and updates RFC 5065 by deprecating the origination of BGP routes with AS\_CONFED\_SET (Type 4 AS\_PATH segment). Finally, it obsoletes RFC 6472.},
