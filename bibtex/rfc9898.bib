    abstract =  {The Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol is a critical component of the IPv6 architecture. The protocol uses multicast in many messages. It also assumes a security model where all nodes on a link are trusted. Such a design might be inefficient in some scenarios (e.g., use of multicast in wireless networks) or when nodes are not trustworthy (e.g., public access networks). These security and operational issues and the associated mitigation solutions are documented in more than twenty RFCs. There is a need to track these issues and solutions in a single document. To that aim, this document summarizes the published ND issues and then describes how all these issues originate from three causes. Addressing the issues is made simpler by addressing the causes. This document also analyzes the mitigation solutions and demonstrates that isolating hosts into different subnets and links can help to address the three causes. Guidance is provided for selecting a suitable isolation method to prevent potential ND issues.},
