    abstract =  {This document specifies requirements for the development of MPLS Network Actions (MNAs) that affect the forwarding or other processing of MPLS packets. These requirements are informed by a number of proposals for additions to the MPLS information in the labeled packet to allow such actions to be performed, either by a transit or terminating Label Switching Router (i.e., the Label Edge Router - LER).},
