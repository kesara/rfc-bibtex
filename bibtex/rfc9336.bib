    abstract =  {RFC 5280 specifies several extended key purpose identifiers (KeyPurposeIds) for X.509 certificates. This document defines a general-purpose Document-Signing KeyPurposeId for inclusion in the Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension of X.509 public key certificates. Document-Signing applications may require that the EKU extension be present and that a Document-Signing KeyPurposeId be indicated in order for the certificate to be acceptable to that Document-Signing application.},
