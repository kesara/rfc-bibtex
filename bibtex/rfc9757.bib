    abstract =  {This document introduces extensions to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) to support path computation in Native IP networks through a PCE-based central control mechanism known as Centralized Control Dynamic Routing (CCDR). These extensions empower a PCE to calculate and manage paths specifically for Native IP networks, thereby expanding PCEP's capabilities beyond its past use in MPLS and GMPLS networks. By implementing these extensions, IP network resources can be utilized more efficiently, facilitating the deployment of traffic engineering in Native IP environments.},
