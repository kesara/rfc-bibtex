    abstract =  {In situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) is an example of an on-path hybrid measurement method. IOAM defines a method for producing operational and telemetry information that may be exported using the in-band or out-of-band method. RFCs 9197 and 9326 discuss the data fields and associated data types for IOAM. This document defines a YANG module for the configuration of IOAM functions.},
