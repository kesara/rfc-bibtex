    abstract =  {This document specifies an extension to the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol that allows an ACME server to validate the Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) Node ID for an ACME client. A DTN Node ID is an identifier used in the Bundle Protocol (BP) to name a "singleton endpoint": an endpoint that is registered on a single BP Node. The DTN Node ID is encoded both as a certificate Subject Alternative Name (SAN) identity of type otherName with an Other Name form of BundleEID and as an ACME Identifier type "bundleEID".},
