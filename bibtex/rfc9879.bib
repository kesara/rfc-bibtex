    abstract =  {This document specifies additions and amendments to RFCs 7292 and 8018. It also obsoletes the RFC 9579. It defines a way to use the Password-Based Message Authentication Code 1 (PBMAC1), defined in RFC 8018, inside the PKCS \#12 syntax. The purpose of this specification is to permit the use of more modern Password-Based Key Derivation Functions (PBKDFs) and allow for regulatory compliance.},
