    abstract =  {This document defines a Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+) client YANG module that augments the System Management data model, defined in RFC 7317, to allow devices to make use of TACACS+ servers for centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA). Though being a standard module, this module does not endorse the security mechanisms of the TACACS+ protocol (RFC 8907), and TACACS+ be used within a secure deployment. The YANG module in this document conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in RFC 8342.},
