    abstract =  {The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) does not include query capabilities for finding the list of domains related to a set of entities matching a given search pattern. Considering that an RDAP entity can be associated with any defined object class and other relationships between RDAP object classes exist, a reverse search can be applied to other use cases besides the classic domain-entity scenario. This document describes an RDAP extension that allows servers to provide a reverse search feature based on the relationship defined in RDAP between an object class for search and any related object class. The reverse search based on the domain-entity relationship is treated as a particular case.},
