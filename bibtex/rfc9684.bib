    abstract =  {This document defines the YANG Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) and configuration nodes that are required to retrieve attestation evidence about integrity measurements from a device, following the operational context defined in RFC 9683 "TPM-based Network Device Remote Integrity Verification". Complementary measurement logs originating from one or more Roots of Trust for Measurement (RTMs) are also provided by the YANG RPCs. The defined module requires the inclusion of the following in the device components of the composite device on which the YANG server is running: at least one Trusted Platform Module (TPM) of either version 1.2 or 2.0 as well as a corresponding TPM Software Stack (TSS), or an equivalent hardware implementation that includes the protected capabilities as provided by TPMs as well as a corresponding software stack.},
