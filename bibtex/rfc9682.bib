    abstract =  {The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), as defined in RFCs 8610 and 9165, provides an easy and unambiguous way to express structures for protocol messages and data formats that are represented in Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) or JSON. This document updates RFC 8610 by addressing related errata reports and making other small fixes for the ABNF grammar defined for CDDL.},
