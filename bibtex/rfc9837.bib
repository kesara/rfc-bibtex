    abstract =  {This document describes an experiment in which VPN service information is encoded in an experimental IPv6 Destination Option. The experimental IPv6 Destination Option is called the VPN Service Option. One purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate that the VPN Service Option can be deployed in a production network. Another purpose is to demonstrate that the security measures described in this document are sufficient to protect a VPN. Finally, this document encourages replication of the experiment.},
