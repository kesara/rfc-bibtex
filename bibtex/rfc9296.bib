    abstract =  {RFC 5309 defines the Point-to-Point (P2P) circuit type, one of the two circuit types used in the link-state routing protocols, and highlights that it is important to identify the correct circuit type when forming adjacencies, flooding link-state database packets, and monitoring the link state. This document provides advice about the ifStack for the P2P interface over a LAN Type to facilitate operational control, maintenance, and statistics.},
