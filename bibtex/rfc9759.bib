    abstract =  {Estimating time requirements for tasks, both critical and mundane, remains a challenge in engineering, business, and everyday communication. Existing models fail due to inherent unpredictability and inconsistencies in human estimation. This document introduces the Two-Week Principle (TWP), a novel, universally adaptable time scale that seeks to standardize all temporal references to a singular, uniform duration. TWP ensures clarity, predictability, and synchronization across all sectors that rely on time-based scheduling.},
