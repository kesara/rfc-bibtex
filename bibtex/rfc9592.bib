    abstract =  {This document retires and obsoletes the Tao of the IETF as an IETF-maintained document. This document also obsoletes RFC 6722, which describes the publication process of the Tao. Furthermore, this document describes the rationale for the retirement of the Tao. For archival purposes, the last version of the Tao is included in the appendix. Information that new participants need to engage in the work of the IETF will continue to be provided through the IETF website in a more timely and accessible manner. This is the way.},
