    abstract =  {This document specifies how Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for multipoint networks can provide sub-second failover for routers that participate in Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM). An extension to the PIM Hello message used to bootstrap a point-to-multipoint BFD session is also defined in this document.},
