    abstract =  {In general, linear network coding can improve the network communication performance in terms of throughput, latency, and reliability. BATched Sparse (BATS) code is a class of efficient linear network coding scheme with a matrix generalization of fountain codes as the outer code and batch-based linear network coding as the inner code. This document describes a baseline BATS coding scheme for communication through multi-hop networks and discusses the related research issues towards a more sophisticated BATS coding scheme. This document is a product of the Coding for Efficient Network Communications Research Group (NWCRG).},
