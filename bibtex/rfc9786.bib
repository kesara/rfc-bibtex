    abstract =  {The Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation (MC-LAG) group technology enables establishing a logical link-aggregation connection with a redundant group of independent nodes. The objective of MC-LAG is to enhance both network availability and bandwidth utilization through various modes of traffic load balancing. RFC 7432 defines an EVPN-based MC-LAG with Single-Active and All-Active multihoming redundancy modes. This document builds on the existing redundancy mechanisms supported by EVPN and introduces a new active/standby redundancy mode, called 'Port-Active'.},
