    abstract =  {This document defines the RTP payload format for the streaming of a video signal encoded as a sequence of JPEG 2000 codestreams. The format allows sub-codestream latency, such that the first RTP packet for a given image can be emitted before the entire image is available to or encoded by the sender.},
