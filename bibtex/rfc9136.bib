    abstract =  {The BGP MPLS-based Ethernet VPN (EVPN) (RFC 7432) mechanism provides a flexible control plane that allows intra-subnet connectivity in an MPLS and/or Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO) (RFC 7365) network. In some networks, there is also a need for dynamic and efficient inter-subnet connectivity across Tenant Systems and end devices that can be physical or virtual and do not necessarily participate in dynamic routing protocols. This document defines a new EVPN route type for the advertisement of IP prefixes and explains some use-case examples where this new route type is used.},
