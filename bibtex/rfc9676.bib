    abstract =  {This document describes LEX, a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace identifier that identifies, names, assigns, and manages persistent resources in the legal domain. This specification allows adoption of a common convention by multiple jurisdictions to facilitate ease of reference and access to resources in the legal domain. This specification is an Independent Submission to the RFC Series. It is not a standard and does not have the consensus of the IETF.},
