    abstract =  {This document describes a new document series intended for use as a repository for IETF operations documents, which should be more ephemeral than RFCs, but more referenceable than Internet-Drafts, and with more clear handling procedures than a random Web page. It proposes to establish this series as an RFC 3933 process experiment. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.},
