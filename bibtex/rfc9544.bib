    abstract =  {This document defines a set of metrics for networking services with performance requirements expressed as Service Level Objectives (SLOs). These metrics, referred to as "Precision Availability Metrics (PAMs)", are useful for defining and monitoring SLOs. For example, PAMs can be used by providers and/or customers of an RFC 9543 Network Slice Service to assess whether the service is provided in compliance with its defined SLOs.},
