    abstract =  {This document specifies a network model for attachment circuits. The model can be used for the provisioning of attachment circuits prior or during service provisioning (e.g., VPN, Network Slice Service). A companion service model is specified in the YANG Data Models for Bearers and 'Attachment Circuits'-as-a-Service (ACaaS) (I-D.ietf- opsawg-teas-attachment-circuit). The module augments the base network ('ietf-network') and the Service Attachment Point (SAP) models with the detailed information for the provisioning of attachment circuits in Provider Edges (PEs).},
