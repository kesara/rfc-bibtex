    abstract =  {The document specifies a common attachment circuits (ACs) YANG data model, which is designed to be reusable by other models. This design is meant to ensure consistent AC structures among models that manipulate ACs. For example, this common model can be reused by service models to expose ACs as a service, service models that require binding a service to a set of ACs, network and device models to provision ACs, etc.},
