    abstract =  {Many networks configure the IGP link metric relative to the link capacity, and high bandwidth traffic gets routed per the link capacity. Flexible Algorithms provide mechanisms to create constraint-based paths in an IGP. This specification documents a generic metric-type and a set of bandwidth-related constraints to be used in Flexible Algorithms. This document updates RFC 9350.},
