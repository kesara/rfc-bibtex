    abstract =  {This document describes the applicability of IPv6 over constrained-node networks (6lo) and provides practical deployment examples. In addition to IEEE Std 802.15.4, various link-layer technologies are used as examples, such as ITU-T G.9959 (Z-Wave), Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth LE), Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications - Ultra Low Energy (DECT-ULE), Master-Slave/Token Passing (MS/TP), Near Field Communication (NFC), and Power Line Communication (PLC). This document targets an audience who would like to understand and evaluate running end-to-end IPv6 over the constrained-node networks for local or Internet connectivity.},
