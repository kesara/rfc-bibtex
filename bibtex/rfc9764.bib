    abstract =  {The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol is commonly used to verify connectivity between two systems. BFD packets are typically very small. It is desirable in some circumstances to know not only that the path between two systems is reachable, but also that it is capable of carrying a payload of a particular size. This document specifies how to implement such a mechanism using BFD in Asynchronous mode. YANG modules for managing this mechanism are also defined in this document. These YANG modules augment the existing BFD YANG modules defined in RFC 9314. The YANG modules in this document conform to the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) (RFC 8342).},
