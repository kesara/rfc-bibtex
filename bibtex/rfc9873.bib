    abstract =  {The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) does not inherently support internationalized email addresses because the specifications for these addresses did not exist when EPP was developed. This document describes a command-response extension that adds support for associating an additional email address with an EPP contact object. That additional email address can be either an internationalized email address or an ASCII-only address.},
