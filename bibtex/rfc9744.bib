    abstract =  {This document describes a new EVPN Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) service type specifically for multiplexing multiple attachment circuits across different Ethernet Segments (ESs) and physical interfaces into a single EVPN-VPWS service tunnel and still providing Single-Active and All-Active multi-homing. This new service is referred to as the EVPN-VPWS Flexible Cross-Connect (FXC) service. This document specifies a solution based on extensions to EVPN-VPWS (RFC 8214), which in turn is based on extensions to EVPN (RFC 7432). Therefore, a thorough understanding of RFCs 7432 and 8214 are prerequisites for this document.},
