    abstract =  {This document updates the specification of the 'ipn' URI scheme previously defined in RFC 6260 and the IANA registries established in RFC 7116. It also updates the rules for the encoding and decoding of these URIs when used as an Endpoint Identifier (EID) in the Bundle Protocol version 7 (BPv7) as defined in RFC 9171. These updates clarify the structure and behavior of the 'ipn' URI scheme, define new encodings of 'ipn' scheme URIs, and establish the registries necessary to manage this scheme.},
