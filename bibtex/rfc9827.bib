    abstract =  {This document clarifies and extends the meaning of Transform Type 5 in Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2). It updates RFC 7296 by renaming Transform Type 5 from "Extended Sequence Numbers (ESN)" to "Sequence Numbers (SN)". It also renames two currently defined values for this Transform Type: value 0 from "No Extended Sequence Numbers" to "32-bit Sequential Numbers" and value 1 from "Extended Sequence Numbers" to "Partially Transmitted 64-bit Sequential Numbers".},
