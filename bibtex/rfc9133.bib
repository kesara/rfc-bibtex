    abstract =  {This document specifies an extension to the Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) signal channel protocol so that DOTS clients can control their filtering rules when an attack mitigation is active. Particularly, this extension allows a DOTS client to activate or deactivate existing filtering rules during a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack. The characterization of these filtering rules is conveyed by a DOTS client during an 'idle' time (i.e., no mitigation is active) by means of the DOTS data channel protocol.},
